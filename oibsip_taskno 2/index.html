              <p class="early-edu">
                Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram,
                a small town in Tamil Nadu, India. He hailed from a modest
                background and faced various challenges during his childhood.
                Despite these hurdles, Kalam displayed an unwavering
                determination to pursue education and make a difference in the
                world.<br />

                He completed his schooling in Rameswaram and later attended St.
                Joseph's College in Tiruchirappalli, where he studied physics.
                Kalam then pursued his dream of becoming an aeronautical
                engineer and enrolled at the Madras Institute of Technology
                (MIT). There, he specialized in aerospace engineering and
                graduated with a degree in 1954.<br />

                He joined the Defence Research and Development Organization
                (DRDO) as a scientist and started working on India's missile and
                space programs. In 1960, he moved to the United States and
                undertook advanced studies in rocket engineering at the NASA
                Langley Research Center and the Goddard Space Flight Center.<br />

                Through his rigorous education and dedication to scientific
                research, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam laid the foundation for his
                illustrious career in missile and space technology. His early
                experiences shaped his character and instilled in him a passion
